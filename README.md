## Overview

Welcome to MiniBlog, a simple blogging platform where users can create, edit, and delete posts, view all posts, filter by tags, and read posts. This project utilizes a JavaScript foundation with ReactJS for the frontend and Firebase as the backend service for authentication and database management. It leverages React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useReducer for state management and custom hooks to interact with Firebase functions for various operations like updating, deleting, creating, logging in, registering, and logging out.

## Functionalities

- **Create Post**: Users can create new posts and publish them on the platform.
- **Edit Post**: Existing posts can be edited by users to update their content.
- **Delete Post**: Users have the ability to delete posts they no longer wish to keep.
- **View All Posts**: Users can browse through all posts available on the platform.
- **View My Posts**: Users can see the posts they have authored.
- **Search by Tags**: Posts can be filtered based on tags, enabling users to find relevant content.
- **Read Post**: Users can read individual posts to consume their content.

## Stack

- **JavaScript + ReactJS**: The frontend of the application is built using JavaScript and the ReactJS library, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Firebase**: Firebase serves as the backend service for authentication and database management, offering secure user authentication and efficient data storage.
- **Hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer)**: React hooks are utilized for managing state, handling side effects, and managing complex state logic within functional components.
- **Custom Hooks**: Custom hooks are implemented to encapsulate Firebase functions for operations such as updating, deleting, creating, logging in, registering, and logging out, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
- **React Router**: React Router was used to manage navigation and routing. Allowing users to navigate between different parts of the application without refreshing the page.
